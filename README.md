Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, we created a program to help high school students calculate how investments will grow over time in order to teach them about fiscal responsibility.

What did you do particularly well?
Something I think I did well was organization.  Some of my code could have been more readable, but I defined my functions and left the main program simple, reserved mostly for looping through the program, collecting input, calling functions, and catching errors.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One way that comes to mind would be add additional error handling.  While completing the project, I was unable to figure out how to catch incorrect input types (inputting a string instead of an integer for example) without causing an infinite loop.  I could also improve the formatting of the menus, coding them more efficiently and properly aligning the columns, perhaps using setw() and setfill().

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
This project was one of very few programs that I created without existing code or some kind of template, so I found it confusing trying to remember or figure out which includes were needed.  After a comparison with my past project and some research on what several of them did, I was able to figure it out.  I also had a few issues with error handling (described in question 3) that I was unable to solve, so I included a FIXME to adjust later.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project was excellent for figuring out how to create a program from a Functional Requirements document and accommodating the companyâ€™s standards.  

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to name my variables and functions appropriately so that it could be easily understandable.  I also used comments to explain what I was doing with my code, making it easy to identify what I was doing, and perhaps what needs to change.
